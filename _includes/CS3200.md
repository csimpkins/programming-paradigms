# CS 3200 Programming Paradigms

## Instructors

**IMPORTANT**: Include [CS3200] in the subject of course-related email, e.g., "Subject: [CS3200] Exam 2 Question." Professors are deluged with email. If we don't respond, don't take it personally. Just resend your email with a friendly reminder.

## Course Description

The only constant is change. Computer scientists and software engineers need to be equipped to adapt to changes in the theoretical and practical lanscape of computing. CS 3200 is a practical introduction to programming paradigms and the principles underlying the design of all programming languages. Students begin by rounding out their practical experience in programming paradigms by learning functional programming and programming language principles, then see these paradigms and principles applied in two additional programming langauges. At the end of this course students will have a foundation in programming language principles, practical experience with three representative programming languages, and a theoretical and practical framework for easily learning new languages in the future.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to define, describe and recognize examples of the principles of:

- Many cool things.

Students will also be able to write, debug and predict the behavior of programs that use these principles in programs composed of up to 20 major abstractions (e.g., classes) in up to 20 source files.

## Requirements

### Grading

* Homework: 60%
* Exams: 20%
* Final Exam: 20%

Grade Cutoffs: A: 90, B: 80, C: 70, D: 60

### Assignments

Bi-weekly homework programming assignments, two in-class written exams, and an in-class written final exam.

#### Academic Integrity and Collaboration

We expect academic honor and integrity from students. Please study and follow the academic honor code of Georgia Tech: http://www.policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/code-conduct. You may collaborate on homework assignments, but your submissions must be your own. You may not collaborate on in-class programming quizzes or exams.

#### Due Dates, Late Work, and Missed Work

* Programming assignments are submitted via Georiga Tech's private GitHub (http://github.gatech.edu). Programming quizzes are due by the end of class. Homework assignments are due at 23:59 on the due date. Multiple resubmissions are allowed, so submit early and often so you aren't in a rush on the due date. Late submissions receive a 0.

* There are no makeup exams. Exceptions are only considered under special circumstances such as serious illness, hospitalization, death in the family, judicial procedures, military service, or official school functions. Provide us with a copy of your letter from the registrar in advance for official school functions. For other excused absences you must provide documentation to the Dean of Students **within one week of your return from illness/activity**. The Dean of Students will verifiy your excuse and send us a notice. Excusal from coursework or make-up opportunities are granted at the sole discretion of your instructor.

#### Grade contest

To contest any grade you must submit an official regrade form to the Head TA **within one week of the assignment's original return date**. The original return date is the date the exam was first made available for students to pick up or the grade was posted online in the case of homework assignments and programming quizzes.

### Class Participation

Lecture and workshop/recitation attendance is required and assumed.

## Course Outline

* Week 1 - Week 4: Functional Programming

  - Introduction to functional programming in Standard ML

* Week 5 - Week 10: Principles of Programming Languages

  -  Syntax, type theory, binding, safety, polymorphism, more functional programing in Standard ML

* Week 11 - Week 13: Scala

  - Scala is a statically-typed object-oriented functional language with a rich type system that compiles to JVM bytecode. Scala suports functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming. In this part of the course students learn the features of Scala using the conceptual framework developed in the first half of the course and implement a functional-reactive web service application.

* Week 14 - Week 15: JavaScript

  - JavaScript (or ECMA Script 6) is a dynamically typed scripting language with prototype-based OOP and first-class functions that is typically used to program web pages. In this part of the course students learn the features of JavaScript using the conceptual framework developed in the first half of the course and implement a dynamic web interface (a "one page web app") that consumes the services provided by the Scala web service application developed previously.

## Prerequisites

At least one of:

* Undergraduate Semester level CS 1332 Minimum Grade of C


## Course Materials

* Required software:

  - Standard ML of New Jersey, available at http://www.smlnj.org/
  - Scala, available at http://www.scala-lang.org/
  - JavaScript, available at http://www.ecmascript.org/
  - Swift, available at https://swift.org/

* Official textbooks:

  - Programming in Standard ML, by Robert W. Harper. http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/smlbook/book.pdf
  - Practical Foundations for Programming Languages, 2nd Edition, by Robert W. Harper. http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/plbook/2nded.pdf
  - Programming in Scala, 3rd Edition, by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon and Bill Venners. http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_3ed
  - Learning JavaScript, 3rd Edition, by Ethan Brown. http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035534.do


There are four textbooks, but two of them are availble electronically for free and the others are inexpesive. Even if you bought hard copies (where available) the total cost would be under $150.
