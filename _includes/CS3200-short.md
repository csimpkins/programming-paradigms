## Course Description

The only constant is change. Computer scientists and software engineers need to be equipped to adapt to changes in the theoretical and practical lanscape of computing. CS 3200 is a practical introduction to programming paradigms and the principles underlying the design of all programming languages. Students begin by rounding out their practical experience in programming paradigms by learning functional programming and programming language principles, then see these paradigms and principles applied in three additional programming langauges. At the end of this course students will have a foundation in programming language principles, practical experience with four representative programming languages, and a theoretical and practical framework for easily learning new languages in the future.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to define, describe and recognize examples of the principles of:

- Many cool things.

Students will also be able to write, debug and predict the behavior of programs that use these principles in programs composed of up to 20 major abstractions (e.g., classes) in up to 20 source files.

## Requirements

### Assignments

Bi-weekly homework programming assignments, two in-class written exams, and an in-class written final exam.

## Course Outline

* Week 1 - Week 3: Functional Programming

  - Functional programming in Standard ML

* Week 4 - Week 8: Principles of Programming Languages

  -  Syntax, types, binding, safety, polymorphism, further practice writing functional programs in Standard ML

* Week 9 - Week 11: Scala

  - Scala is a statically-typed object-oriented functional language with a rich type system that compiles to JVM bytecode. In this part of the course students learn the features of Scala using the conceptual framework developed in the first half of the course and implement a functional-reactive web service application.

* Week 12 - Week 13: JavaScript

  - JavaScript (or ECMA Script 6) is a dynamically typed scripting language with prototype-based OOP and first-class functions that is typically used to program web pages. In this part of the course students learn the features of JavaScript using the conceptual framework developed in the first half of the course and implement a dynamic web interface (a "one page web app") that consumes the services provided by the Scala web service application developed previously.

* Week 14 - Week 15: Swift

  - Swift is a statically-typed object-oriented langauge with functional features. While Swift is open source and available on all platforms, it was developed to be the primary programming language for developing software for Apple Mac OS X (desktop applications), iOS (iPhones and iPads) and tvOS (Apple TV). In this part of the course students learn the features of Swift using the conceptual framework developed in the first half of the course and implement a client application for iOS or open source Swift that consumes the services provided by the Scala web service application developed previously.
